# SecondEverToDoList
Mark II of my [FirstEverToDoList](https://adroitnightsun.github.io/FirstEverToDoList/), this can add tasks in localstorage and access them, so it basically doesnt loose its data when refreshed.

To access it, just click [SecondEverToDoList](https://adroitnightsun.github.io/SecondEverToDoList/)
